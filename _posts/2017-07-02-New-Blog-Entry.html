<p> Well it's great to be back. This time on my own terms!<!--more--> After crossing some rough hurdles, I decided it was the time to come back to the blogging world. I originally had a site <a href ="https://ahabitualgamer.blogspot.com/">here</a>, but I wanted a fresh modern style. In came <a href="https://jten11.wixsite.com/habitualgamer">this site.</a>
I loved the style, but I couldn't stand all those wix borders! After that I wanted to have a site of similar style, but made from scratch. A couple months later, and here we are! </p>

<p>
With this site, I accomplish to share my thoughts within the gaming world. Whatever interests me will be posted here. I originally posted MMORPG related stuff, but since stopped playing and trying out other genres, my posts will be a bit more well rounded, as far as PC gaming is concerned. I've been away for a while so there's a lot of stuff to talk about, including anything dealing with Nintendo Switch, to going over my Steam Library. I'll try to maintain a regular posting schedule, so there's always something to look forward to during the week. If you're new to my content, welcome! For the five or six who read my other blogs, I hope to keep providing the best I can. Until next time!</p>
