<p>Out of nowhere, Doomfist gets revealed on the Overwatch PTR! Of all the new characters that released, this one I'm looking forward to the most.<!--more--> To be honest, I thought a new character was coming later this month, but an early surprise is okay! Upon hearing Doomfist's voice, I had a feeling Terry Crews wasn't going to be the voice actor. I feel he's a little too American for a West African character, but I'm sure he would've made it work. The actor Blizzard chose, however, is superb. Great job there. Looking forward to the many in-game convos with the other characters, especially Reaper and Widowmaker.</p>

<p>Looking at his abilities, he really looks in-your-face with his rocket punch-ground smash combo. And his ultimate. As soon as I saw it, it immediately reminded me of my Great Weapon Fighter's special ability in Neverwinter. Pretty awesome, in my opinion. I was looking for a CGI cinematic, but we get a origins video instead. I have to say, this is the most fluid origins cinematic I've seen. The videos in the past were mostly stills with some animation. Doomfist's origin vid almost looked like something off Cartoon Network or something. Very impressed. Looking forward to trying him out when he goes live!</p>
