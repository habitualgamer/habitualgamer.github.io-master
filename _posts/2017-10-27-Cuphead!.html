<p> As soon as I saw it, it immediately reminded me of my Great Weapon Fighter's special ability in Neverwinter. Pretty awesome, in my opinion. I was looking for a CGI cinematic, but we get a origins video instead. I have to say, this is the most fluid origins cinematic I've seen. The videos in the past were mostly stills with some animation. Doomfist's origin vid almost looked like something off Cartoon Network or something. Very impressed. Looking forward to trying him out when he goes live!</p>
