Cuphead is one of the games that I had to succumb to the hype, and I'm glad I did. It's a fun, yet difficult game. It'll charm the pants off ya, and fustrate you at the same time. At this point I'm sure you're aware of it's incredible difficulty, yet I managed it to beat it over the weekend. It wasn't easy though! Now I'm going over the expert stages, and let me tell you, they aint pushovers!

If you haven't gotten the game yet, what are you waiting for? It's cheap right now, and you may let lucky and get this cheaper under a steam sale. Go get this!
